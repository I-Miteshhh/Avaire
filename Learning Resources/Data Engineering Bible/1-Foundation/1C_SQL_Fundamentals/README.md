## üó∫Ô∏è **Module Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Fundamentals** (BEGINNER)

**Topics:**
- How databases execute queries (parser ‚Üí optimizer ‚Üí executor)
- Index types (B-tree, hash, composite)
- OLTP vs OLAP (when to use which)
- Window functions (rankings, running totals, moving averages)

**Key Analogies:**
```
Database = Library
- Index = Card catalog (find books quickly)
- Full table scan = Check every book on every shelf
- Query optimizer = GPS (finds fastest route)

OLTP = Cashier (fast transactions)
OLAP = Accountant (complex analysis)
```

**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Prerequisites:** Basic SQL (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY)

---

### **Phase 2: Performance Tuning** (INTERMEDIATE)

**Topics:**
- Reading EXPLAIN plans (Seq Scan, Index Scan, Hash Join)
- Query optimization techniques
  - Adding indexes
  - Selecting only needed columns
  - Avoiding functions on indexed columns
  - Rewriting subqueries as JOINs
- Join algorithms (Nested Loop, Hash, Merge)
- Advanced indexing (covering, partial, expression indexes)
- CTEs and recursive queries
- Table partitioning (range, list, hash)

**Hands-On Exercise:**
```sql
-- Optimize this slow query (45 seconds ‚Üí <1 second)
SELECT
    customers.name,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count,
    SUM(orders.total) AS total_spent
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
WHERE orders.status = 'completed'
  AND orders.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY customers.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Steps:
1. Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE
2. Identify bottlenecks (Seq Scan, missing indexes)
3. Add indexes
4. Re-run and measure improvement
```

**Time:** 4-5 hours  
**Prerequisites:** SQL proficiency, basic understanding of indexes

---

### **Phase 3: Database Internals** (EXPERT)

**Topics:**
- Storage models (row-oriented vs column-oriented)
- B-tree internals (how indexes work on disk)
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
- Query optimizer cost calculations
- Sharding strategies (range, hash, geo-partitioning)
- Advanced SQL patterns
  - Running aggregates
  - Moving averages
  - Top N per group
  - Gap detection
  - Sessionization
- 10 FAANG interview questions with solutions

**Real-World Systems:**
```

- Users, Tweets, Follows, Likes tables
- Fan-out on write for timeline generation
- Hybrid approach for celebrities

Sharding at Scale:
- 10 billion rows across 10 servers
- Hash sharding by customer_id
- Scatter-gather for cross-shard queries
```

**Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Prerequisites:** Database concepts, distributed systems knowledge

---

### **Phase 4: Theoretical Foundations** (WHITEPAPERS)

**Topics:**
- **Codd (1970):** Relational model, normalization
- **Gray (1981):** ACID properties, transaction isolation levels
- **Brewer (2000):** CAP theorem (Consistency vs Availability)
- **Selinger (1979):** Cost-based query optimization
- **Stonebraker (2005):** Column stores for OLAP

**Key Concepts:**
```
ACID:
- Atomicity: All or nothing
- Consistency: Valid state transitions
- Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
- Durability: Committed data persists

CAP Theorem:
- Can't have Consistency + Availability during network partition
- Choose CP (MongoDB, HBase) or AP (Cassandra, DynamoDB)
```

**Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Prerequisites:** Database fundamentals from BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE

## üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-On Exercises**

### **Exercise 1: Add the Right Index** (BEGINNER)
```sql
-- Slow query
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 123 AND status = 'shipped';

-- Task: Create an index to speed this up
-- Question: Single-column or composite? Which column first?
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
-- Composite index (customer_id first - more selective)
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_status ON orders(customer_id, status);

-- Why this order?
-- customer_id is more selective (filters to ~100 orders)
-- status is less selective (20% of orders are 'shipped')
```
</details>

---

### **Exercise 2: Optimize with EXPLAIN** (INTERMEDIATE)
```sql
-- Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on this query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE oi.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Tasks:
-- 1. Identify bottlenecks (Seq Scan? Missing index?)
-- 2. Add appropriate indexes
-- 3. Measure performance improvement
```

---

### **Exercise 3: Window Functions** (INTERMEDIATE)
```sql
-- Find the 2nd highest salary in each department
-- Without using LIMIT or subqueries
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT
        department,
        employee_name,
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY department
            ORDER BY salary DESC
        ) AS rk
    FROM employees
)
SELECT department, employee_name, salary
FROM ranked
WHERE rk = 2;
```
</details>

---

### **Exercise 4: Sharding Design** (EXPERT)
**Scenario:** You have an `orders` table with 10 billion rows growing by 10M/day.

**Tasks:**
1. Choose a sharding strategy (range, hash, or geo)
2. Define shard key
3. Explain how to handle this query:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending';
   ```
4. What happens when you add a new shard?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Sharding Strategy:** Hash by `customer_id`

**Reasoning:**
- Evenly distributes data
- Most queries filter by customer_id (fast)

**Shard key:** `customer_id % 10` (10 shards)

**Handling COUNT query:**
```
1. Scatter: Send query to all 10 shards in parallel
2. Each shard: SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE status = 'pending'
3. Gather: Sum results from all shards
4. Return total count

Note: Slower than single-customer queries (must hit all shards)
```

**Adding new shard:**
```
1. Change shard function: customer_id % 11
2. Rebalance data (expensive!)
3. Alternative: Use consistent hashing to minimize data movement
```
</details>

## ‚ùì **FAQ**

**Q: Should I start with BEGINNER or INTERMEDIATE?**  
A: If you can write JOINs and GROUP BY, start with INTERMEDIATE. BEGINNER is for SQL basics review.

**Q: Do I need to read WHITEPAPERS?**  
A: Not required for practical work, but highly recommended for understanding the "why" behind database design choices.

**Q: Which database should I practice on?**  
A: PostgreSQL (open source, well-documented, powerful). MySQL is also good. Avoid proprietary DBs for learning.

**Q: How do I know if my query is slow?**  
A: 
- < 10ms: Fast (index-based lookup)
- 10-100ms: Acceptable (simple aggregation)
- 100ms-1s: Slow (needs optimization)
- \> 1s: Very slow (critical issue)

**Q: When should I add an index?**  
A: 
- Columns in WHERE clauses (especially selective ones)
- Columns in JOIN conditions
- Columns in ORDER BY (if sorting is slow)
- NOT for columns with low cardinality (gender, boolean)

**Q: What's the difference between RANK and DENSE_RANK?**  
A:
- **RANK:** Skips ranks after ties (1, 2, 2, 4)
- **DENSE_RANK:** No skipping (1, 2, 2, 3)

**Q: How do I partition a table in PostgreSQL?**  
A:
```sql
-- Create parent table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id BIGINT,
    order_date DATE,
    ...
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

-- Create partitions
CREATE TABLE orders_2024 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```
