## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Path

### Week 1: Foundations
- [ ] Beam model (PCollections, PTransforms)
- [ ] Windowing strategies
- [ ] Triggers and accumulation modes
- [ ] Side inputs for enrichment

### Week 2: Advanced + Production
- [ ] Portability framework
- [ ] Runner-specific optimizations
- [ ] Exactly-once semantics
- [ ] Production deployment (Dataflow, Flink)

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Project: Multi-Runner Pipeline

Build a real-time analytics pipeline that runs on DirectRunner, FlinkRunner, and DataflowRunner without code changes.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Process 100K events/sec
- [ ] Deploy on 3 different runners
- [ ] Achieve exactly-once guarantees
- [ ] Monitor with metrics

**Next Module:** [Week 12-13: Lakehouse Architecture ‚Üí](../../3-Advanced/3D_Lakehouse/)
