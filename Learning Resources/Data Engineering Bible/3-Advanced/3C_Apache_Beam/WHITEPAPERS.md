# Week 10-11: Apache Beam â€” WHITEPAPERS Track

*"The Dataflow Model paper fundamentally changed how we think about stream processing. Understanding it deeply is essential for any data engineer."* â€” Engineering Fellow, Microsoft

## ðŸ“œ 1. The Dataflow Model (2015) - Google

**Citation:** Akidau, Tyler, et al. "The dataflow model: a practical approach to balancing correctness, latency, and cost in massive-scale, unbounded, out-of-order data processing." VLDB 2015.

### Core Innovation: What/Where/When/How

```
The Four Questions Framework:

1. WHAT computations?
   â†’ ParDo, GroupByKey, Combine transformations

2. WHERE in event time?
   â†’ Fixed, Sliding, Session, Global windows

3. WHEN to emit results?
   â†’ Triggers: Watermark, ProcessingTime, Count, Composite

4. HOW to refine results?
   â†’ Accumulation: Discarding, Accumulating, Retracting
```

**Problem Solved:** Lambda architecture requires two codebases (batch + stream). Dataflow unifies them.

## ðŸ“œ 2. MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing (2013) - Google

**Citation:** Akidau, Tyler, et al. "MillWheel: fault-tolerant stream processing at internet scale." VLDB 2013.

**Key Concepts:**
- Strong consistency with exactly-once delivery
- Low watermarks for progress tracking
- Persistent state with checkpointing

**Beam's Implementation:** Watermarks, exactly-once semantics, stateful processing inherited from MillWheel.
