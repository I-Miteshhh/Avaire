# Cloud & Service Mapping - Part 1 (Sections 0–11)

## 0. Executive Snapshot (Strategic Rationale)
Multi-cloud and cross-service abstraction is not about chasing hype; it is strategic risk mitigation (lock-in, regional regulatory divergence), latency optimization to user clusters, and cost agility across providers. The failure mode is building a brittle “lowest common denominator” layer that erodes feature velocity.

| Objective | Business Driver | Engineering Lever | Success Metric | 12-Month Strategic Outcome (Illustrative) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Reduce Lock-In Risk | Negotiating leverage on spend | Portable data abstractions (Iceberg, OpenLineage, Terraform) | % critical workloads deployable to second cloud | ≥ 60% portability coverage |
| Latency Optimization | Regional user expansion | Multi-region replication & traffic steering | p95 read latency (EU vs US) | < 220ms cross-region |
| Cost Flexibility | Spot & transient pricing exploitation | Workload scheduling policies | % batch hours on spot/preemptible instances | ≥ 40% spot utilization |
| Regulatory Compliance | Data residency laws (EU, India) | Policy-driven data placement (tag & enforce) | Residency policy violations | Zero monthly infractions |
| Innovation Velocity | Avoid feature lag | Polyglot managed services behind contracts | Time to adopt new analytic feature | < 4 weeks backlog adoption |

Strategic Principle: Choose deep abstraction for data plane (formats, lineage, orchestration) and light abstraction for control plane (jobs, query API) to enable selective provider optimization.

## 1. ELI10 Analogy
Imagine you have three toy stores (AWS, Azure, GCP). Each sells similar toy types: cars, dolls, puzzles—but the shelves are arranged differently. If you label your boxes using a universal sticker (open table format like Iceberg) and decide where to buy based on price or closeness (cost/latency), you can move toys between stores easily. Building a system that only allows plain cubes because every store sells cubes wastes cool new toys (feature lock-out). Good mapping keeps the universal sticker while still allowing advanced shelf features when needed.

---

## 2. Problem Framing (Why This Is Hard)
Challenges undermining multi-cloud and service abstraction efforts:
1. Feature Divergence: Managed services evolve fast (Snowflake, BigQuery) causing abstraction staleness.
2. Hidden Egress Costs: Moving data between clouds triggers high, sometimes unpredictable, transfer charges.
3. Identity & IAM Fragmentation: Different permission models create inconsistent security posture.
4. Observability Inconsistency: Tracing, metrics naming and cardinality differ across providers.
5. Data Gravity: Large datasets practically anchored by ingest velocity—copying terabytes daily often impractical.
6. Operational Tooling Drift: Distinct pipelines for each cloud create double maintenance overhead.
7. Latency Cascades: Cross-cloud API calls chain into high p95 latencies for composite workloads.
8. Failure Domain Complexity: Multi-cloud failover can widen blast radius if poorly isolated.
9. Cost Modeling Complexity: Distinct unit economics (GB scanned vs queries vs storage tiers) hinder unified chargeback.
10. Compliance Policy Enforcement: Non-uniform tagging standards (resource labels vs tags vs metadata) hamper automated guardrails.

## 3. Core Concepts & Terminology
| Concept | Definition | Architectural Role | Principal Insight |
|---------|------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Control Plane | APIs & orchestration layer (jobs, queries) | Coordinates workloads & metadata | Keep thin for portability; avoid vendor-native lock-in wrappers unless high ROI. |
| Data Plane | Physical data storage & movement layer | Houses datasets, streams | Standardize on open formats (Parquet/Iceberg) before building cross-cloud replication. |
| Open Table Format (Iceberg/Delta) | Unified abstraction for table snapshots & schema management | Enables consistent governance across engines | Iceberg favors manifest modularity; Delta offers transaction log simplicity; choose based on ecosystem adoption. |
| Service Equivalence Matrix | Mapping of provider services delivering similar capability | Guides substitution & portability | Document functional & non-functional deltas, not just names. |
| Interoperability Contracts | Stable schemas & interfaces enabling cross-engine reuse | Decouple producers from cloud-specific APIs | Contracts must contain latency & cost expectations to prevent pathological queries. |
| Data Gravity | Tendency of large datasets to attract dependent services to same location | Informs placement decisions | Replicate compute toward data, not vice versa, unless strict latency constraints. |
| Egress Economics | Pricing model for data transfer out of region/provider | Governs replication strategy | Use differential replication policies (hot vs cold tables). |
| Federated Query | Query across multiple engines or storage backends | Reduces duplication | Accept trade-off: increased planning latency and unpredictable cost. |
| Identity Federation | Single identity spanning clouds (OIDC/SAML) | Unifies access control | Guard against weakest-link escalation (multi-cloud compromised principal). |
| Policy-as-Code | Declarative compliance & governance rules (OPA, Azure Policy) | Automates enforcement | Policy drift detection must be part of CI gates. |
| Workload Classification | Tagging jobs by latency/cost/security sensitivity | Schedules to optimal environment | High value ML training may use spot fallback policies with checkpointing. |

## 4. Multi-Cloud Reference Architecture Overview

```
           +-----------------------------------------------------------+
           |                    Unified Control Layer                  |
           |  (Orchestrator: Airflow / Argo + Policy Engine: OPA)      |
           +--------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
                          |                    |
                  +-------+------+      +------+-------+
                  |  Cloud A     |      |   Cloud B    |      (Optionally Cloud C)
                  |  (AWS)       |      |   (Azure)    |
                  +------+-------+      +------+-------+
                         |                     |
          +--------------+-------+   +---------+--------------+
          |   Open Table Format   |   |  Open Table Format    |  (Replicated Snapshots w/ selective datasets)
          |  (Iceberg / Delta)    |   |  (Iceberg / Delta)    |
          +-----------+-----------+   +------------+----------+
                      |                            |
            Compute Engines (EMR/Spark,        Compute Engines (Databricks/Synapse/Trino)
            Trino, Flink)                      
                      |                            |
        Observability (Prometheus,            Observability (Prometheus, Azure Monitor exporter)
        OpenTelemetry Collector)               
                      |                            |
             Security & IAM (IAM Roles,        Security & IAM (Entra ID, RBAC, Managed Identities)
             STS + OIDC Federation)            
```

Key Flows:
1. Metadata Sync: Iceberg catalog replication (e.g., using REST + snapshot diffs) for selected tables.
2. Policy Distribution: OPA bundles pushed to both clouds; evaluations happen locally.
3. Observability Convergence: Metrics scraped and aggregated (Thanos / Cortex) to global view; trace IDs uniform.
4. Data Movement: Event-driven replication of hot tables (CDC or incremental snapshots) vs periodic cold table sync.

Architectural Tenet: Accept asymmetry—do not force identical service usage if one provider offers materially superior feature (e.g., specialized ML). Abstract only where net value > engineering cost.

## 5. Service Equivalence Matrix (Foundations)
| Capability | AWS | Azure | GCP | OSS Substitute | Notes |
|------------|-----|-------|-----|----------------|-------|
| Object Storage | S3 | ADLS Gen2 (Blob) | GCS | MinIO | Uniform API challenge—prefer abstraction via SDK+feature detection. |
| Data Warehouse | Redshift | Synapse SQL | BigQuery | Trino / ClickHouse | BigQuery pricing (per scan) vs Synapse compute-hour—cost model divergence. |
| Lakehouse / Managed Spark | EMR / Glue / Databricks | Databricks / Synapse Spark | Dataproc | Spark (self-managed) | Databricks multi-cloud unifies partially. |
| Streaming (Pub/Sub) | Kinesis/MSK | Event Hubs | Pub/Sub | Kafka | Throughput pricing & retention semantics differ. |
| Workflow Orchestration | Step Functions | Data Factory / Azure Pipelines | Cloud Composer | Airflow / Argo | Airflow neutral but requires governance overlays. |
| ML Platform | SageMaker | Azure ML | Vertex AI | Kubeflow | Feature drift—avoid over-abstraction for model experimentation. |
| Monitoring & Metrics | CloudWatch | Azure Monitor | Cloud Monitoring | Prometheus / OpenTelemetry | Consolidate via OTEL collector pipeline. |
| Secrets Management | Secrets Manager | Key Vault | Secret Manager | HashiCorp Vault | Align rotation & audit semantics. |
| Policy & Governance | AWS Config / IAM Policies | Azure Policy / RBAC | Org Policy / IAM | OPA / Kyverno | Express canonical rules in OPA; compile cloud-native equivalents. |
| Table Format Catalog | Glue Catalog | Purview / Hive Metastore | Dataproc Metastore | Nessie / Hive / REST Catalog | Choose neutral Iceberg catalog for portability. |

Principal Insight: The matrix must track not only FUNCTIONAL equivalence but NON-FUNCTIONAL deltas (latency, regional availability, pricing model, SLA, scaling behavior) because trade-offs often hinge on non-functional attributes.

## 6. Abstraction Patterns
| Pattern | Description | Strength | Weakness | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Thin Provider Wrapper | Minimal adapter translating resource names & configs | Low overhead | Limited cross-cloud orchestration | Early adoption; maintain agility |
| Unified Interface Layer | Stable API (e.g., internal DSL for queries/jobs) | Simplifies migration | Risk of lowest common denominator | When provider churn high; watch feature lock-out risk |
| Event-Driven Replication | CDC or snapshot diff triggers cross-cloud sync | Incremental movement | Complexity of consistency windows | Hot tables with latency sensitivity |
| Central Policy Orchestrator | Single OPA bundle repo; distributed evaluation | Uniform governance | Requires robust version auditing | Multi-cloud compliance & InfoSec alignment |
| Data Access Gateway | One ingress enforcing auth, tagging, rewriting | Consistent security & audit | Can add latency; single choke point risk | When query governance critical |
| Observability Aggregation | Global metrics store (Thanos) federating scrapes | Holistic view | Cardinality explosion risk | Cross-cloud SRE dashboards |
| Multi-Engine Table Format | Iceberg/Delta providing engine neutrality | Avoid duplication | Manifest/metadata management overhead | Multi-analytic engine scenario |
| Workload Placement Advisor | Scheduler picks provider per cost/performance | Optimized spend | Requires accurate predictive models | Large-scale batch/ML scheduling |

Architect Decision Lens: Evaluate abstraction ROI vs feature impedance. Accept partial heterogeneity for innovation-critical subsystems.

---

## 7. Data Gravity & Egress Economics
Key Principle: Minimize unnecessary data motion; replicate only data with cross-cloud consumption justification.

| Data Category | Replication Policy | Justification | Egress Cost Strategy |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Hot Aggregates | Near real-time (CDC) | Latency-critical dashboards multi-region | Batch compress + minimal meta fields |
| ML Feature Store Snapshots | Daily diff replicate | Model training parity across regions | Column subset projection before transfer |
| Raw Event Streams | Single-cloud anchor + derived subset replicate | Avoid transfer flood | Pre-aggregate counts/histograms upstream |
| Compliance Critical (PII) | Hosted only in jurisdiction-specific cloud | Regulatory | Tokenization for aggregated exports |
| Cold Historical | On-demand only | Rare query | Flag request triggers asynchronous copy |

Egress Guardrails:
- Pre-transfer pruning (drop unused columns, filter by date range).
- Compression selection: ZSTD mid-level for transfer (balanced CPU vs ratio).
- Consolidate small files before transfer; avoid per-object overhead.
- Monitor transfer TB/month vs budget forecast; alert on variance >15%.

Egress Cost Modeling Example (Illustrative):
```
Replicating 10 TB/day across regions @ $0.05/GB = $500/day = $15K/month.
Apply pruning (reduce 40%) + only replicate hot subsets (60% of days) → effective (10 * 0.6 * 0.6) TB = 3.6 TB/day → $180/day → $5.4K/month (64% savings).
```

## 8. Failure Modes (Multi-Cloud & Abstraction)
| Failure Mode | Symptom | Root Cause | Detection | Mitigation | Prevention |
|--------------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Stale Abstraction Layer | New provider feature unavailable | Overly rigid unified API | Feature request backlog > SLA | Allow passthrough vendor extensions | Version contract w/ extension mechanisms |
| Runaway Egress Spend | Monthly transfer cost spikes | Over-replication; no pruning | Transfer spend growth >15% week-over-week | Implement pruning & scheduling | Replication policy managed in Git + review |
| IAM Policy Divergence | Inconsistent privilege sets | Manual mapping errors | Access audit diff across clouds | Central identity federation + policy compilation | Automated policy sync pipeline |
| Data Drift Across Clouds | Query results inconsistent | Delayed replication or failed CDC | Cross-cloud consistency check failing | Trigger catch-up replication job | SLA monitors for replication lag |
| Observability Blind Spots | Missing metrics in global dashboard | Collector misconfig or naming mismatch | Dashboard gap scan | Normalize naming + fallback logging | Standard metric schema contract |
| Latency Explosion | p95 query latency across cloud jumps | Cross-cloud synchronous chained calls | Trace span duration > threshold | Introduce local caching + async patterns | Design latency budget per tier |
| Compliance Breach (Residency) | Data found outside jurisdiction | Mis-tagged dataset replicated | Residency scan mismatch | Rapid quarantine + delete remote copy | Tag validation gate pre-replication |
| Metadata Fork | Divergent schema versions cloud A vs B | Replication job partial failure | Hash diff of schema manifests | Force snapshot sync; reconcile differences | Atomic replication transactions |
| Cost Model Inaccuracy | Chargeback disputes | Mismatched units (scan bytes vs slot time) | Variance analysis >10% | Normalize units via internal pricing translation | Unified telemetry aggregator |
| Single Gateway Bottleneck | Throughput saturation | Centralized rewriting service unscaled | 95th percentile latency > budget | Horizontal scale or adopt sidecar model | Capacity planning & autoscale policies |

## 9. Interoperability Benchmarks (Foundational)
Benchmark Pillars:
1. Metadata Synchronization Latency (seconds from schema change in cloud A to availability in cloud B).
2. Cross-Cloud Query Latency (federated vs native query delta).
3. Replication Lag (time from data commit in source to target readiness).
4. Egress Efficiency (% of transferred bytes vs raw unpruned size).
5. Policy Convergence Time (OPA bundle commit → active across clouds).
6. Consistency Accuracy (% of sampled queries returning identical results).

Benchmark Harness Sketch:
```python
SCENARIOS = [
  {'change':'add_column','table':'orders'},
  {'change':'rename_column','table':'users'},  # test complexity
]

for sc in SCENARIOS:
    apply_schema_change(sc, cloud='A')
    start = now()
    while not reflected_in_cloud_B(sc):
        sleep(1)
    latency = now() - start
    record_metric('metadata_sync_latency_seconds', latency)
```

Federated Query Comparison:
```sql
-- Native (Cloud A)
SELECT country, SUM(amount) FROM orders WHERE event_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7' DAY GROUP BY country;

-- Federated (Cross-cloud engine pulling remote subset)
SELECT country, SUM(amount) FROM orders@cloudB WHERE event_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7' DAY GROUP BY country;
```
Capture planning, execution latency, scan bytes.

Report Template:
| Scenario | Metric | Native | Federated | Delta | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|-------|
| 7d aggregate | Latency (s) | 3.2 | 5.9 | +2.7 | Accept cost for cross-cloud presence |
| Metadata add column | Sync latency (s) | 0 (origin) | 47 | +47 | Optimize snapshot propagation |

## 10. Security & IAM Parity Fundamentals
Principles:
- Least Privilege Uniformity: Translate roles not by naming but by permission semantics.
- Central Identity: Use OIDC tokens recognized across clouds; map to provider-native identities.
- Policy Compilation: Source-of-truth YAML → compiled provider-specific IAM/Role definitions.

Policy Source Example:
```yaml
role: data_analyst
permissions:
  read_tables:
    - orders
    - users
  write_tables: []
  query_engines:
    - trino
    - spark
  lineage_access: true
  sensitive_columns:
    - users.email (masked)
```

Compilation Workflow:
1. Parse generic policy.
2. Generate AWS IAM policy JSON, Azure RBAC role definition, GCP IAM bindings.
3. Validate using dry-run (simulate denying one expected permission).
4. Deploy via Terraform pipelines.

Masking Consistency: Ensure column-level masking semantics identical across engines (Trino view filters, Spark column substitution).

Audit Strategy: Daily diff of effective permissions across clouds; alert on divergence.

## 11. Observability Foundation (Unified Telemetry)
Metric Schema Contract:
| Metric | Labels | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| cloud_query_latency_seconds | cloud, engine, query_type | Performance comparison |
| replication_lag_seconds | cloud, table | Data freshness governance |
| metadata_sync_latency_seconds | source_cloud, target_cloud, table | Schema propagation health |
| egress_bytes_total | source_cloud, target_cloud, dataset | Transfer cost tracking |
| policy_apply_latency_seconds | cloud, policy_version | Governance rollout speed |
| consistency_diff_count | table, cloud_pair | Data divergence early warning |

OpenTelemetry Collector Design:
```
[Cloud A] OTEL Collector  ─┐
                          ├─>  Global Aggregator (Thanos / Cortex / Loki for logs)
[Cloud B] OTEL Collector  ─┘
```

Tracing Strategy:
- Propagate `x-trace-id` across replication workers & query engines.
- Span attributes: `cloud`, `region`, `replication_phase`, `bytes_transferred`.

SLO Examples:
- 95% metadata sync latency < 60s.
- Replication lag p95 < 120s for hot tables.
- Consistency diff count = 0 (critical datasets).

Alert Example (PromQL):
```
(consistency_diff_count > 0) AND on(table) (replication_lag_seconds > 300)
```
Indicates lag causing divergence.
