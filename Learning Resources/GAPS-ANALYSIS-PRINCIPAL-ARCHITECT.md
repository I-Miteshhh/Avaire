   - Logs: Event records (ELK, Loki, CloudWatch Logs)
   - Traces: Request flow (Jaeger, Zipkin, X-Ray)
   - When to use each, and how they complement

2. **Metrics Strategy**
   - **RED Method** (for services):
     * Rate: Requests per second
     * Errors: Error rate
     * Duration: Latency distribution (P50, P95, P99)
   - **USE Method** (for resources):
     * Utilization: CPU, memory, disk, network
     * Saturation: Queue depth, thread pool usage

   - Example SLOs for data platform:
     * Data freshness: 99% of data available within 5 minutes
     * API availability: 99.9% uptime
     * Query latency: P95 < 1 second

       - Disk usage > 85%
   - Code: Alert rules (YAML)

7. **Debugging Production Issues**
   - **Scenario 1: API Latency Spike**
     * Step 1: Check metrics (which endpoint?)
     * Step 2: Check traces (where is time spent?)
     * Step 3: Check logs (any errors?)

     * Resolution: Slow downstream API, add circuit breaker
   - **Scenario 3: Increased Costs**
     * Step 1: Check cost breakdown by service
     * Step 2: Identify anomaly (sudden increase in Kinesis?)
     * Step 3: Investigate (producer sending duplicates?)
     * Resolution: Bug in producer, deploy fix
   - Provide complete debugging workflows
