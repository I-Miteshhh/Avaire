## üí° SOLID Principles Quick Reference

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

```
‚ùå Bad: Class handles parsing AND validation AND storage
‚úÖ Good: Separate classes for Parser, Validator, Repository
```

**Real Example:** Kafka Producer
- Producer handles message sending
- Serializer handles data conversion
- Partitioner handles partition selection

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

```
‚ùå Bad: Modify class to add new behavior
‚úÖ Good: Extend through interfaces/abstract classes
```

**Real Example:** Spark DataSource API
- Add new data source without modifying Spark core
- Implement DataSourceV2 interface

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

```
‚ùå Bad: Subclass breaks parent class contract
‚úÖ Good: Subclass can replace parent without issues
```

**Real Example:** Collection hierarchy
- ArrayList, LinkedList can substitute List

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

```
‚ùå Bad: Fat interface with many methods
‚úÖ Good: Multiple focused interfaces
```

**Real Example:** Java I/O
- Readable, Writeable, Closeable (separate interfaces)

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

```
‚ùå Bad: Depend on concrete implementations
‚úÖ Good: Depend on abstractions (interfaces)
```

**Real Example:** Repository pattern
- Service depends on Repository interface
- Can swap implementations (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

## üöÄ Real-World Case Studies

### 1. LRU Cache (Google, Amazon)

**Problem:** Implement cache with O(1) get, put, and eviction

**Solution:**
- HashMap for O(1) lookup
- DoublyLinkedList for O(1) eviction (LRU)
- Maintain head (most recent), tail (least recent)

**Patterns Used:** Composite (HashMap + LinkedList)

**Complexity:**
- get(): O(1)
- put(): O(1)
- Space: O(capacity)

### 2. Rate Limiter (Meta, Stripe)

**Problem:** Limit requests per user per time window

**Solutions:**
- **Token Bucket:** Refill tokens at fixed rate
- **Sliding Window:** Count requests in rolling window
- **Fixed Window:** Reset counter at fixed intervals

**Patterns Used:** Strategy (different algorithms)

**Distributed:** Redis with atomic operations

### 3. Parking Lot System (Amazon, Microsoft)

**Problem:** Multi-floor parking with different vehicle types

**Patterns Used:**
- Factory (vehicle creation)
- State (spot status: available, occupied, reserved)
- Strategy (pricing: hourly, flat, dynamic)
- Singleton (parking lot instance)

**Complexity:**
- parkVehicle(): O(F * S) where F = floors, S = spots
- removeVehicle(): O(1)

### 4. URL Shortener (Google, Bitly)

**Problem:** Convert long URL to short code

**Solutions:**
- **Distributed ID Generation:** Snowflake algorithm
  * 41 bits: timestamp
  * 10 bits: machine ID
  * 12 bits: sequence number
- **Encoding:** Base62 (0-9, a-z, A-Z)
- **Distribution:** Consistent hashing for sharding

**Patterns Used:**
- Factory (encoder), Strategy (encoding algorithms)

**Complexity:**
- createShortUrl(): O(1)
- getLongUrl(): O(1) with cache, O(log n) without

### 5. Notification System (Uber, LinkedIn)

**Problem:** Multi-channel notifications with priority and retry

**Patterns Used:**
- Observer (subscribers)
- Strategy (channels: email, SMS, push, in-app)
- Template Method (common notification flow)
- Chain of Responsibility (retry logic with exponential backoff)

**Concurrency:**
- PriorityBlockingQueue for priority ordering
- ExecutorService for parallel delivery
- Semaphore for rate limiting

### 6. Distributed Cache (Redis, Memcached)

**Problem:** In-memory cache distributed across nodes

**Patterns Used:**
- Strategy (eviction: LRU, LFU, FIFO)
- Singleton (cache instance per node)
- Proxy (routing to nodes)

**Key Techniques:**
- **Consistent Hashing:** Virtual nodes for even distribution
- **Eviction Policies:** LRU (access order), LFU (frequency)
- **Replication:** Master-replica for fault tolerance
- **TTL:** Auto-expiration with background cleanup

## üîç Common Interview Mistakes

### 1. Jumping to Code Too Quickly

```
‚ùå Bad: Start coding without clarifying requirements

‚úÖ Good:
1. Ask clarifying questions (scale, constraints, functional/non-functional requirements)
2. Discuss high-level approach and alternatives
3. Choose approach and explain trade-offs
4. Then code
```

### 2. Not Discussing Trade-offs

```
‚ùå Bad: "I'll use a HashMap"

‚úÖ Good:
"We could use:
1. HashMap: O(1) lookup but unordered, no range queries
2. TreeMap: O(log n) lookup but ordered, supports range queries
3. Trie: O(m) lookup where m = key length, good for prefix operations

For this problem, HashMap is best because..."
```

### 3. Ignoring Concurrency

```
‚ùå Bad: Single-threaded implementation only

‚úÖ Good:
"In production with concurrent access, we need:
1. ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe cache
2. ReadWriteLock for read-heavy workloads
3. Atomic operations for counters
4. Lock-free data structures where possible"
```

### 4. Not Handling Edge Cases

```
‚ùå Bad: Assume inputs are always valid

‚úÖ Good:
1. Null/empty checks
2. Boundary conditions (capacity = 0, negative values)
3. Concurrent modification
4. Resource cleanup (finally blocks, try-with-resources)
```

### 5. Poor Code Organization

```
‚ùå Bad: Everything in one class, long methods

‚úÖ Good:
1. Separate concerns (SRP)
2. Small methods (< 20 lines)
3. Meaningful names
4. Clear interfaces
```
